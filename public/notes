Context api is used to reduce the props drilling as in the root to last children it is difficult to go to last child using prop.    it use two things producer(it is the component which is used to oldest children with some value or context ) and consumer(which is used to consumes thecontext and gets the value.)// name="nickname"
      // initialValue={profile.value}
      // onSave={onSave}
      // // mb stand for margin bottom//
      // label={<h6 className="mb-2">Nickname</h6>}
    //blob is used to convert image into binary form
    // why do we use currentRoomContext() instead of useContext() as both are use as the context api.

    //04/july/2022 denormalising data: it means copying or duplicate our data, and we use this prevent ouself from performing multiple request from data. as in the message we need to get through the profile and room data so we duplicate that data.
